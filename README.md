# number_wizard
A (very) simple Unity 5 game

This was created as practice for Unity3d from the Udemy unity3d course.

It's a very simple game where the computer tries to guess a number you're thinking of.

The game is live at http://gamebucket.io/game/c3c31885-fc1a-482d-8c68-2273a4b45c7a until Nov. 5th, 2016.
